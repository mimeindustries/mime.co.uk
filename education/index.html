		<h3>Design & Technology</h3>
		<p>Learn about the mechanics that make robots move and how everything fits together. Tie in to robotics in the curriculum and learn what makes it go.</p>

		<h3>Computing</h3>
		<p>Use the range of existing <a href="http://apps.mime.co.uk">apps</a> to teach children about the basic principles of computing. Start with a simple visual programming tool and work up to using real languages like Javascript. Use the MeArm with the Raspberry Pi to use apps with it too.</p>

		<h3>Mathematics</h3>
		<p>Using turtle robotics to draw geometric shapes is a classic way of getting children engaged in thinking about physical mathematical problems.</p>

		There are apps available covering most skill levels, from basic point-and-click apps for beginners to more involved drag-and-drop block-based apps. Here's a selection, but you can see them all at <a href="http://apps.mime.co.uk">apps.mime.co.uk</a>. All apps are completely free, cross platform and run in your web browser which means there's no software that needs installing before you can use Mirobot. There are a similar range of apps available for running on the Raspberry Pi with MeArm.

		<h3>Point and Click</h3>
		<p>Use this app to let young children control Mirobot and make it draw things. Great for building up spatial awareness skills.</p>

<section>
	<div class="inner">
		<img class="left" src="/assets/education/blockly.png" />
		<h3>Blockly</h3>
		<p>A good first step towards programming Mirobot. Use this simple block based programming language to build an understanding of things like loops and other simple control structures.</p>

<section>
	<div class="inner">
		<img class="right" src="/assets/education/snap.png" />
		<h3>Snap!</h3>
		<p>Snap! is a Scratch clone that runs in your browser which lets children tackle more complex programming challenges like line following or collision detection.</p>

<section>
	<div class="inner">
		<img class="left" src="/assets/education/javascript.png" />
		<h3>Javascript</h3>
		<p>Once children have progressed beyond more visual programming languages, Javascript is a good next step which will keep them challenged.</p>
