I first started Mirobot as a side project at the beginning of 2011 and never thought it would consume most of the next seven years of my life. After successfully Kickstarting the first version in 2014, it felt like a good plan to turn Mirobot into a product so that users all over the world could build their own and it's since been sent to over 60 countries around the world. From then on it's all been a bit of a rollercoaster ride! Another Kickstarter for the v2, and eventually joining forces with Ben Gray and his MeArm and releasing the v3 with Mime Industries last year.

After seven years, I've decided it's time for a change and so have stepped down from Mime, leaving it in the safe hands of Ben Gray who will be continuing the business. As you probably already know, all of the designs, firmware and code for Mirobot are (and always have been) open source so you are still free to build your own from scratch.

I just wanted to say thanks to everybody for all of your support over the past seven years - I couldn't have done it without you all!
